# DataCleaning
This is my first JAVA application, I've put it together with the help of ChatGPT and Stackoverflow. 
It creates the DB tables for itself, parses input from a CSV file and stores the data in the tables.

DB authentication should be configured in the db.properties file.

CSV file path should be entered in the App.java BEFORE running the app.
CreateTables.sql path can be also edited in the App.java in case of need.

Running the App.java application will create the tables (based on the CreateTable.sql script).
